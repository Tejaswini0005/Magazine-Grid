        <p> A magazine is a periodical publication, generally published ona regular schedule(often weekly or monthly), containing a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, purchase price, prepaid subscriptions, or by a combination of the three.</p>
        <p> In the techniacl sense a journal has contiuous pagination throughout a volume. Thus, Bloomberg Businessweek, which starts each issue anew with page one, is a magazine, but the Journal of Business Communication, which continues the same sequence of pagination throughout the coterminous year, is a journal.</p>
        <h2> what is RIP? </h2>
        <p> RIP stands for RestIn Peace. Some professional or trade publications are also peer-rewiewed, for example the Journal of Accountancy. Non-peer-reviewed academic or professional publications are generally professional magazines. The word "magazine" derives from the Arabic makhazin(), the broken plural of makhazan() meaning "depot, storehouse" (originally military storehouse); that comes to English via Middle French magasin and Italian magazzino. In its original sense, the word " magazine" referred to a storage space or device. In the case of written publication, it refers to a collection of written articles.</p>
        <p> HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc, Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
